<p>Started in 1976 in England, The Cure, fronted by vocalist/guitarist Robert Smith, is essential to the origins of post-punk and goth.
    Notably, Robert Smith also recorded and toured with Siouxsie and the Banshees, another iconic goth band, for a period of time that contributed to earlier definitive albums of The Cure.
    To avoid being pigeon-holed as a gloomy group, Robert Smith began steering the band towards a more pop infused sound, becoming a
    definitive staple in the new wave movement of the 80s. Robert Smith and The Cure have continued to release iconic albums over the last
    40 years, adapting and reinventing the group in a vast array of musical tallents and genres.
